<p><img src="http://cathyguerriero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/081613-Cathy-Guerriero-in-LaborPress.jpg" alt="081613 Cathy Guerriero in LaborPress" width="194" height="259" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-989" />Local 372 of District 37 AFSCME, New York City Board of Education Employees, has endorsed Cathy Guerriero for Public Advocate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have never had a candidate meeting that ended in a standing ovation &#8211; I have never seen anything like it.  This was a first.  Cathy Guerriero&#8217;s support of our members, especially our Parent Coordinators, showed us that she is indeed an advocate for children in the public school system and their parents. </p>
<p>Cathy understands the integral part our members &#8212; school aides, health aides, lunchroom workers, parent coordinators, school crossing guards and SAPIS workers &#8212; play in ensuring that our schools run smoothly&#8221; said Pamela Armstrong, Chairperson, Local 372 Political Action Committee.</p>
<p>Santos Crespo, Jr., President of Local 372, said, &#8220;We know that no matter what, Cathy Guerriero will stand for us and will always be our friend.  We look forward to working with her as Public Advocate because nothing is as important to us as providing the support, safety, communication and good nutrition that New York Cityâs public school children need in order to excel in life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Local 372-New York City Board of Education Employees &#8212; is the largest local within District Council 37, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, and represents 26,000 workers throughout New York Cityâs public schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;Education is my highest priority as a parent and a teacher, and it will be my top priority as Public Advocate,â said Guerriero.  âThe hard working members of Local 372 have been there for our children as parent coordinators, crossing guards, school aides and school lunch workers.  They provide important services and deserve elected leaders who understand and can relate to their set of issues and challenges.  As the next Public Advocate, I will demand that the next Mayor bargain in good faith with them. I will demand that the next Mayor keep the parent coordinators on the job as vital links to the parents of children in our public schools.  I will stand hand-in-hand with my friends at Local 372 and work to give our children the education they deserve.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://cathyguerriero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/081413-Monsignor-Sullivan-2.png" alt="081413 Monsignor Sullivan 2" width="478" height="331" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-982" />Cathy Guerriero, candidate for New York City Public Advocate recently met with Monsignor Kevin Sullivan, Executive Director of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York.  They met at the International Center, which is a wonderful program in lower Manhattan that teaches English and American culture to immigrants and other newcomers to New York.  The Immigrant Center, part of Catholic Charities Community Services, is one of the many social service agencies that mark the imprint of the Catholic Church in the social justice fabric of NYC. </p>
<p>Monsignor Sullivan discussed a number of issues of mutual concern, including delivery of services to neighborhoods and families most in need, the mission and mandate of the Office of the Public Advocate, and how that office can better work with faith-based organizations to streamline and expedite delivery of those services.</p>
<p>Guerriero reminisced about her time at Catholic Charities, where she served as Director of Government Relations for Monsignor Sullivan.  Cathy was also Director for Strategic Planning for the Archdiocese of New York and the Associate Director of the 2008 Papal Visit. </p>
<p>âWhen it comes to strategic planning as it relates to an ever-increasing population, no organization does it better than Catholic Charities,â said Guerriero.  âGovernment can learn by their example.  Government and religious institutions should work together in order to serve those in our care, and communication is key.  I thank Monsignor Sullivan for his advice and wisdom on these matters, and more.â </p>
<p>Dr. Guerriero, an adjunct professor at both Teachers College and New York University, comes from a family of teachers, police officers and firefighters.  Both of her parents were public school teachers, and for 35 years her father worked two jobs: teacher by day and at night he worked as a longshoremenâs security guard for the Port Authority, helping to provide for Cathy and her five siblings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://politicker.com/2013/08/school-employees-union-endorses-cathy-guerriero-ken-thompson/">By Jill Colvin, New York Observer</a></em></p>
<p><img src="http://cathyguerriero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Observer-Photo.jpg" alt="Cathy Guerriero." width="277" height="208" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-978" />Local 372, the union representing more than 25,000 parent coordinators, crossing guards and other school aides has endorsed Cathy Guerriero for public advocate.</p>
<p>âCathyâs interview was outstanding. I mean, you very rarely get a standing ovation on any screening. So that was the response of the members,â the unionâs president, Santos Crespo Jr. told Politicker, this afternoon.</p>
<p>He noted that Ms. Guerriero seemed to have an especially strong familiarity with the members represented by the union, and pointed to her background as an educator and her stance against mayoral control of city schools.</p>
<p>âWe need a public advocate whoâs going to take on the mayor, no matter who the mayor is,â he added.</p>
<p>While Ms. Guerriero, once considered a long-shot, has been racking up various endorsements, the decision is a bit of a snub for Brooklyn City Councilwoman Letitia James, who has long been an advocate for school workers and has been targeting many of the minority black and Latino women that the union represents.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Ms. James noted, however, that she has the support of a long list of major unions, including the larger DC-37 municipal workersâ union, as well as SEIU 32BJ, TWU Local 100 and CWA 1180. The two are also up against State Senator Daniel Squadron, Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani and civilian police official Sidique Wai.</p>

<p>Cathy Guerriero indicÃ³ que uno de los retos de la ciudad de Nueva York es el insoportable desempleo. âLa gente estÃ¡ perdiendo sus casas. La fuerza de nuestras escuelas estÃ¡ en juego. Las empresas se ven abrumados por el papeleo burocrÃ¡tico. Estamos perdiendo la confianza en nuestros lÃ­deresâ, subrayÃ³ Guerriero.</p>
<p>Guerriero indicÃ³ que a muchos padres se les ha dicho que los empleos del cuidado y protecciÃ³n de sus niÃ±os ya no estÃ¡ disponible. âLos maestros âdijo- han tenido que hacer las maletas e irse a casa. El apoyo con el que contaban los niÃ±os ya no estÃ¡ mÃ¡sâ.</p>
<p>SeÃ±alÃ³ que âel Defensor PÃºblico es para asegurarse de que todos los neoyorquinos se beneficien de las decisiones tomadas por nuestro alcalde, para seÃ±alar problemas y dar soluciones. La educaciÃ³n de nuestros hijos es una gran parte de esto. Me asegurarÃ© de que su voz sea escuchadaâ.</p>
<p>Igualmente sostuvo que en Nueva York hemos llegado a un punto crÃ­tico para la clase media. A su juicio, nunca antes los obreros y la clase media neoyorquinos han sido tan marginados del acceso a una casa propia que se ha tornado un lujo comprar o alquilar.</p>
<p>âDebemos establecer soluciones permanentes para atender a las familias vulnerables. Debemos asegurarnos de que las familias trabajadoras no pierdan sus hogaresâ, seÃ±alÃ³ Cathy Guerriero.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Another Huge Endorsement for Surging Public Advocate Candidate</h3>
<p>Cathy Guerriero, candidate for New York City Public Advocate announced that her campaign has earned the endorsement of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association (UFOA).  </p>
<p>Guerriero leads the way in this race with over 60 endorsements, from unions/locals, advocacy groups, faith-based leaders, political clubs and media.  Of those endorsements, 24 are from organizations representing uniformed personnel.  Recently Guerriero was endorsed by the Uniformed Firefighters Association and the New York City Patrolmenâs Benevolent Association.</p>
<p>âThe endorsement of the UFOA is particularly important and deeply appreciated,â said Guerriero.  âMembers of my family, past and present, have proudly served in the FDNY.  We all owe the firefighters and officers who risk their lives daily our continued thanks and support, and we owe the retirees who have done their service what is due to them.  As Public Advocate I will stand steadfast with the UFOA to oppose staffing reductions, and I will work with them to fix the cityâs 911 emergency system so life-saving services can be dispatched as quickly as possible.  Furthermore, we simply must stop closing firehouses in a city with a growing population, with new development projects going up all around us.  When it comes to saving lives and property, we need more, not less.  I am proud of the UFOAâs support, and I will never let our brave firefighters and officers down.â</p>
<p>Al Hagan, President of the UFOA said, âCathy Guerriero impressed us with her knowledge of the issues at hand and the challenges we face, especially since the last decade has been the busiest in the FDNYâs 148-year history.  Public safety is our priority, and as New Yorkers we all need elected leaders who will push hard for the resources needed to help keep our communities safe.  Cathy knows the importance of keeping firehouses open and our engine and ladder companies fully staffed.  She has the passion, energy and dedication to make a real difference as Public Advocate, so the UFOA is proud to give her our full support.â     </p>
<p>The Uniformed Fire Officers Association represents over 2,500 active and over 4,500 retired Lieutenants, Captains, Battalion Chiefs, Deputy Chiefs, Supervising Fire Marshals and Medical Officers in the FDNY.</p>
<p>A senior adjunct professor, former star athlete and small business owner, Guerriero comes from a union family of teachers, police officers and firefighters.  Both of her parents were public school teachers, and for 35 years her father worked two jobs: teacher by day and at night he worked as a longshoremenâs security guard for the Port Authority, helping to provide for Cathy and her five siblings.   </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Visits Service Providers, Community Leaders in Vibrant Brooklyn Neighborhood</h3>
<p>New York, NY â Cathy Guerriero, candidate for New York City Public Advocate met with leaders of Borough Parkâs Jewish community while visiting the Masbia Kosher soup kitchen and Tomchei Shabbos pantry.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969" alt="BP Rabbis" src="http://cathyguerriero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BP-Rabbis.png" width="600" height="437" /></p>
<p><b>Rabbi Shlomo Braun</b>, who accompanied Guerriero during her recent visit, said âCathy Guerriero has spent time in the neighborhood of Borough Park and understands the needs and values of our community.Â  She has listened and has learned.Â  She is our candidate for Public Advocate because of her ability to reach out and engage in the important discussions regarding the issues and challenges we face.Â  Cathy Guerriero gets the blessing of Borough Park.â</p>
<p>Guerriero also met with <b>Rabbi Oscar Ehrenreich</b>, who has been the principal at the Beth Jacob Elementary School of Borough Park for 59 years.Â  Rabbi Ehrenreich also gave Guerriero his blessing: âWhen I sit and speak with Cathy Guerriero, I am aware above all else of her sincerity.Â  That is why I am happy to give her my blessing to be the next Public Advocate.â</p>
<p>Another meeting that spoke to the passion, strength and resiliency of the Jewish people was when Guerriero sat down with <b>Elka Braun</b>, a 90-year old Holocaust survivor, who showed her pictures of her family (over 100 children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren).Â  âThis family was made possible because I walked out of Auschwitz,â Mrs. Braun told Guerriero.Â  âNever forget, Cathy.Â  Make sure we never forget.â</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-966" alt="Elka" src="http://cathyguerriero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Elka.png" width="300" height="239" />Guerriero said, âAs the faith-based candidate in this race, I understand and can relate to communities who lead with their faith.Â  They do so with a deep belief in a higher power, and that guides them through the daily and long-term challenges that they share with all communities in our great city.Â  I have a profound respect for the Jewish community in Borough Park, for they have worked long and hard to build better lives for their children and their childrenâs children.Â  They value and care for seniors and for those less fortunate no matter what their faith, with the Masbia and Tomshei Shabbos pantry serving as tangible proof of those important core values.â</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-967" alt="Food Pantry" src="http://cathyguerriero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Food-Pantry.png" width="250" height="242" />While in Borough Park last week, Guerriero visited the Masbia which provides free hot meals to that areaâs neediest families, and she volunteered at the Tomchei Shabbos food pantry, getting a first-hand look at the quality and care these important organizations provide to the people of that neighborhood.</p>
<p>A senior adjunct professor, former star athlete and small business owner, Guerriero comes from a union family of teachers, police officers and firefighters.Â  Both of her parents were public school teachers, and for 35 years her father worked two jobs: teacher by day and at night he worked as a longshoremenâs security guard for the Port Authority, helping to provide for Cathy and her five siblings.</p>
<p>Guerriero leads the way in this race with over 60 endorsements, from unions/locals, advocacy groups, faith-based leaders, political clubs and media.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span STYLE="font-variant: small-caps">EMTs</span> and <span STYLE="font-variant: small-caps">EMS</span> Officers Back Surging Public Advocate Candidate</h3>
<p>Cathy Guerriero, candidate for New York City Public Advocate announced that her campaign has earned the endorsement of the Uniformed EMTs Paramedics and Fire Inspectors FDNY Local 2507, and the Uniformed EMS Officers Union FDNY Local 3621.  </p>
<p>Guerriero leads the way in this race with over 60 endorsements, from unions/locals, advocacy groups, faith-based leaders, political clubs and media.  Of those endorsements, 23 are from organizations representing uniformed personnel.  Recently, Guerriero was endorsed by the Uniformed Firefighters Association and the New York City Patrolmenâs Benevolent Association.</p>
<p>âThese important endorsements speak to the heart of our campaign,â said Guerriero.  âThe EMTs and EMS officers literally save lives.  Our elected officials should be doing all they can do to support these heroes, and that includes honoring the pensions of their retirees.  These dedicated professionals help make up New York Cityâs middle class â they form the foundation of our local economy &#8211; and as Public Advocate I will stand with them to fix the cityâs 911 emergency system, I will push for common sense solutions like digitizing and uploading building plans onto a secure and common source to allow first-responders equipped with laptops to access building schematics during emergencies, I will absolutely oppose the short-sighted closings of fire houses, and I will work to protect their pensions which these EMTS and EMS officers so rightly deserve.  When it comes to saving lives and property, we need more, not less.â</p>
<p>Vincent Variale, President of Uniformed Emergency Medical Officers Local 3621, said, âCathy comes from a union household, so she knows first-hand of the strength and security union jobs provide â she gets how important those pensions are to not only the members, but to their families as well.  She is ready for the task ahead: we have a city with a growing population, and we need our elected leaders to help ensure that our emergency services are prepared and supported.  Cathyâs firm commitment to working with us makes her our strong choice for Public Advocate, and we are pleased to endorse her.â</p>
<p>Israel Miranda, President of Uniformed Emergency Medical Technicians Local 2507, said, âCathy Guerriero made a strong and compelling case for this endorsement.  She understands the issues; she cuts to the chase and speaks forcefully about tackling the challenges ahead.  Our EMTs need elected officials who will listen to our concerns and who work with us in coming up with real solutions in order to help save lives, because bottom line, thatâs what this is all about.  Cathy gets it â sheâs tough, smart, works as hard as they come and will be the best advocate for our members and for all who live in our great city.â</p>
<p>The Uniformed EMTs, Paramedics &#038; Fire Inspectors Local 2507 represents over 3,000 of the FDNY EMSC and Fire Inspector employees.  The Uniformed EMS Officers Union Local 3621 represents over 500 of the FDNYâs captains and lieutenants.</p>
<p>A senior adjunct professor, former star athlete and small business owner, Guerriero comes from a union family of teachers, police officers and firefighters.  Both of her parents were public school teachers, and for 35 years her father worked two jobs: teacher by day and at night he worked as a longshoremenâs security guard for the Port Authority, helping to provide for Cathy and her five siblings.</p>

<p>The Patrolmenâs Benevolent Association endorsed Cathy Guerriero for Public Advocate on Aug. 1, with its president, Patrick J. Lynch, saying that her presentation was so impassioned that the unionâs political-education committee not only recommended her but gave her a standing ovation.</p>
<p>Ms. Guerriero, a college professor who was raised in a family of teachers and firefighters, said in an interview after the PBA press conference that municipal unions were flocking to support her candidacy because she vigorously defends their contracts and pensions.</p>
<div>
<p align="center"><strong>âHitching Star to Unionsâ</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>âIâm hitching my star onto the unions of New York City,â she said. With her as Public Advocate, she said, âno oneâs going to take their pensions or their health care away&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>These contracts have to be held harmless.â</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>By Aug. 1, Ms. Guerriero had been endorsed by about 40 unions, 19 of them for uniformed personnel. She said she was expecting additional endorsements in the coming days.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>She started the race at the bottom of the polls, but she cited a Wall Street Journal-NBC 4 New York-Marist College survey taken at the end of June that had her in a statistical tie for the lead with Councilwoman Letitia James. State Sen. Daniel Squadron, former Deputy Public AdvocateÂ Reshma Saujani and education advocate Noah Gotbaum are also in the race.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is her first try for elective office, but, she said, âIâve been planning this for 20 years.â</p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="center"><strong>âShe Has the Passionâ</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>At the press conference announcing the PBA endorsement, Mr. Lynch said, âShe has the passion to believe in the city, believe in the future and understand that this city always needs a check and a balance, and thatâs what the Public Advocate does.â</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He said he had been involved with the unionâs endorsements for 14 years and she was the first candidate to inspire the committee to stand and applaud. âThey said we believe that much in this candidate,â he said.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Ms. Guerriero said she was proud to accept the endorsement. âThey put their lives on the line and they say âmy life before yours,âââ she said of police officers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>She launched into a passionate defense of public-employee pensions, which have come under attack from conservatives and have lost some support among voters. Her father held two full-time union jobs simultaneously: one as a Teacher and one as a longshoremanâs security guard at the Port Authority. âMy father purchased into these pensions for 35 years,â she said. âHe deferred compensation for 35 years&#8230;Keep your hands out of my daddyâs pockets.â</p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="center"><strong>UFA Also Backs Her</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Uniformed Firefighters Association endorsed Ms. Guerriero last week as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>âThis endorsement is as personal as it gets for me,â the candidate said in a statement. âI have family membersâpast and presentâwho are part of a proud tradition of serving in the FDNY.â</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Ms. Guerriero pledged to âunequivocally opposeâ the closing of firehouses, help fix the 911 system, and oppose further staffing reductions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>âIf anything, we need to reopen some of the engine and ladder companies that have been shortsightedly shuttered,â she said.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Ms. Guerriero, a fifth-generation Staten Island resident, was raised there and in Brooklyn and now lives on the Lower East Side with her husband and three-year-old daughter. She has been an adjunct professor of education and politics at Columbia and New York Universities. She also serves as a consultant to small businesses and nonprofits. She has also worked for the Archdiocese of New York and for Catholic Charities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cathy Guerriero, parent, educator and candidate for New York City Public Advocate, put out the following statement today regarding the alarming drop in test scores of students in NYC public schools:</p>
<p>âThis is a slap-in-the-face example of the failure of mayoral control, plain and simple.  Since Mayor Bloomberg took office back in 2002, weâve had almost 12 years to see if his model of school governance worked.  Well, it hasnât.  Children who started in first grade in 2002 are now out of high school â a complete turn of the wheel.  Have these students been better served?  Are their test scores higher?  Are they more prepared for college, or trade school?  The answer is a resounding no.</p>
<p>Since the inception of mayoral control, the real power of teachers, principals and parents has been completely removed from the governance model of the NYC public schools.   When you take these pedagogical experts away from the equation, the result is pretty easy to predict: low test scores, which are partly a product of the Department of Educationâs centralized bunker mentality where bureaucrats reign and common sense is ignored.</p>
<p>When the U.S. Secretary of Education tells us, donât âbe alarmedâ by these low test scores, itâs a clear sign that we should be alarmed and we should demand change.  The next mayor should not continue the Bloomberg form of mayoral control, and I call on those candidates to immediately put forth their detailed plans to better educate our children while including the stakeholders â teachers, supervisors and parents â as a core part of those plans.  </p>
<p>As Public Advocate, you can bet your bottom dollar that I will hold the new mayorâs feet to the fire.  I will fight with the passion of a mother of a daughter soon to start public school for our childrenâs right to receive a quality education; I will stand in the gap with our teachers to demand more input into the education system that they have worked for years to build up and improve; and I will be a leading voice in pushing for the dismantlement of the failed Bloomberg model of mayoral control.  Our children deserve better, and we need real leaders with the intelligence and backbone to help make that happen.â  </p>
<p>Dr. Guerriero, an adjunct professor at both Teachers College and New York University, comes from a family of teachers, police officers and firefighters.  Both of her parents were public school teachers, and for 35 years her father worked two jobs: teacher by day and at night he worked as a longshoremenâs security guard for the Port Authority, helping to provide for Cathy and her five siblings.</p>
